🎤 Presentation Narrative: Adaptive Data Quality System
1. The Problem: The Static Wall (Slides 1-2)
Hook: Start with the pain point specific to your target industry (banking/finance).

Point: Traditional data quality systems are brittle and reactive. They rely on static, hardcoded rules (e.g., "Income must be less than $1,000,000").

The Flaw: These systems cannot detect new, emergent risks (e.g., a massive spike in non-US customer volume, or a sudden, subtle change in the average loan amount) until it's too late. The LLM is blind to data evolution.

Visual Aid:

2. The Adaptive Solution: The AI Data Loop (Slides 3-5)
This section explains the core innovation—the multi-agent system built with LangGraph and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The Adaptive Loop (MCP in Action)
Point: We designed an Adaptive Data Quality Loop using LangGraph where specialized LLM agents continuously monitor and correct the rules themselves.

Agent Roles (The Narrative):

Agent 1: The Profiling Agent (ML): "I detect the signal." This agent runs non-LLM tools (Isolation Forest, Pandas) to find anomalies (the $999,999.00 income) and drift (the unexpected country code spike).

Agent 2: The Rule Generation Agent (LLM): "I write the fix." It receives the ProfilingReport via the MCP and reasons: "Since income is drifting, I will propose a new, tighter rule: max_value=150000.00." It outputs this executable code.

Agent 3: The Validation Agent (Great Expectations): "I enforce the law." It immediately applies the new rule to the incoming data, flagging the outlier record as a FAILURE.

Agent 4: The Refinement Agent (LLM): "I learn from failure." If the new rule caused too many good records to fail (a false positive), this agent critiques the prompt that Agent 2 used and writes a better one into the MCP for the next run. This closes the self-correcting loop.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Point: The MCP (GraphState) is the shared blueprint that makes this collaboration reliable. It standardizes communication, ensuring the Rule Generation Agent always receives a perfect statistical report and the Refinement Agent can dynamically update the LLM's prompt for continuous improvement.

3. LangSmith: The Reliability Backbone (Slides 6-7)
This addresses trust and production readiness, showing the judges you considered deployment.

Point: Since LLMs are non-deterministic, we need complete visibility to trust the adaptive system. LangSmith provides the necessary LLM Observability.

Key Features to Highlight:

Full Agent Tracing: LangSmith maps the entire LangGraph flow for every run. When a data anomaly is quarantined, we can click one link to see the precise path the data took, which LLM call was made, and the exact input/output of every agent.

Debugging/Auditing: If the Rule Generation Agent outputs invalid JSON, LangSmith shows the exact prompt and response that caused the error, allowing for rapid debugging. This is essential for regulatory audit trails.

Performance Metrics: We monitor the latency and token cost of the LLM agents in real-time. This proves our solution is efficient and scalable.

4. Conclusion: Demonstration (Slides 8-9)
The Reveal: Show the demo loop in action (Run 1 vs. Run 2).

Final Takeaway: "We didn't just build a better rule checker. We built a Self-Adapting Data Quality Engine that uses AI to evolve its own rules, ensuring compliance and data trust remain high, even as the market changes."

Adaptive Data Quality System

The Problem – The Static Wall
- Traditional Data Quality Systems Are Broken
- Reliance on static, hardcoded rules (e.g., "Income must be less than $1,000,000")
- Systems are brittle and reactive, not proactive
- Unable to detect new, emerging risks until damage occurs
- Example: Sudden spike in non-US customer volume or subtle changes in loan amounts get unnoticed

The Adaptive Solution — Introducing the AI Data Loop
- The Adaptive Data Quality Loop
- Multi-agent system built with LangGraph and Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Continuous monitoring and automatic rule correction
- Self-evolving rules to catch emergent risks early

Agent 1: The Profiling Agent (ML)
- Agent 1: "I detect the signal"
- Runs non-LLM tools like Isolation Forest and Pandas
- Detects anomalies (e.g., $999,999 income spike) and data drift (unexpected country code changes)

Agent 2, 3 & 4: Rule Generation, Validation, Refinement
- Agents 2, 3 & 4: Writing, Enforcing, and Perfecting the Rules
- Agent 2 (Rule Generation Agent – LLM): Proposes new rules based on profiling report (e.g., max income = $150,000)
- Agent 3 (Validation Agent – Great Expectations): Applies new rules and flags failures on incoming data
- Agent 4 (Refinement Agent – LLM): Learns from false positives and improves the rule generation prompts for next iteration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- The Backbone That Enables Collaboration
- Shared blueprint for reliable communication between agents
- Ensures precise statistical reports for LLM agents
- Dynamically updates prompts for continuous improvement

LangSmith — The Reliability Backbone
- Building Trust with Complete Observability
- Full Agent Tracing to map entire LangGraph workflows per run
- Debugging and Auditing support for regulatory compliance
- Real-time monitoring of latency and token cost for scalability

Demonstration — Adaptive Loop in Action (Run 1 vs. Run 2)
- See It for Yourself
- Run 1: Initial detection and rule failures
- Run 2: Improved rules reduce false positives and catch anomalies effectively

Final Takeaway
- The Future of Data Quality is Self-Adapting
- Not just a better rule checker — a Self-Adapting Data Quality Engine
- AI-driven rule evolution ensures compliance and trust as market conditions shift
- Enables proactive risk management for the banking/finance industry
